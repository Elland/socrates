# Socrates

Socrates is a simple static site generator. It's geared towards blogs. You
write your posts in Markdown and save them as text files on your harddrive.
Socrates then takes them, and creates a full HTML site for you. For free, you
will get a home page which lists latest posts, single post pages, category
pages, and archive pages.
